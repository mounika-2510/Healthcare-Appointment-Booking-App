## 🎯 Challenges Faced and Solutions

### 1. State Management Complexity
**Challenge**: Managing appointment data across multiple components without prop drilling.

**Solution**: Implemented React Context API to create a centralized appointment state that can be accessed by any component in the application. This eliminated the need for complex prop passing and made the code more maintainable.

### 2. Form Validation
**Challenge**: Creating comprehensive client-side validation for the appointment booking form with proper error handling.

**Solution**: Built a custom validation system that checks each field individually and provides specific error messages. Used regex patterns for email and phone validation, and implemented date validation to prevent booking appointments in the past.

### 3. Route Management
**Challenge**: Handling dynamic routes for individual doctor profiles and appointment booking while maintaining clean URLs.

**Solution**: Utilized React Router's dynamic routing with URL parameters (`/doctor/:id` and `/book/:doctorId`) to create SEO-friendly URLs while passing necessary data between components.
